The data package consists of two data sets: DemoData_version_files and DemoData_version_gdb. 
The first set contains the data layers as separate raster and shape files organized into subfolders, the 
latter set contains the data layers in file geodatabase format. The data layers are the same in both 
data sets. The both sets are self-contained and work separately and both data sets contain 
respective .mxd-files. Environments are set in both cases. The DemoData_version_files contain a 
toolbox with simple fuzzy logic model as an example. This works only with DemoData_version_files 
data set. Meta data description with appendix can be found as a separate pdf-files.
